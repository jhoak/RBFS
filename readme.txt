Hello and welcome to the RBFS page. This project implements the NIST model of role-based access control, a form of access control in computer security that indirectly assigns access permissions to users based on their "roles" in the system (which can be likened to their jobs in an organization, or their authority). The project uses a Java client and server with a Microsoft SQL Server 2008-R2 backend, with the Microsoft JDBC driver for SQL Server (ver. 4.1).

The implementation of the NIST model is pretty complete here, although some work needs to be done on fixing small bugs and extending the implementation to handle more databases, as well as a dynamic set of user-defined roles.
